Bonus Calculator
================  

In Class Group Activity (Week 7)
--------------------------------

In this activity we are instructed to create a calculator to determine bonus amounts for employees.  Arrays are given 
with employee information (name, salary, employee number and review rating).  This information is used to calculate 
bonuses.  Calculated information for each employee is pushed into a new array.
