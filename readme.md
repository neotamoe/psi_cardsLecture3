Cards Lecture 3
---------------

Using what we've learned about JS and JQ, we'll create a cards app that will do the following:

- drawCardFromTop: first card in array
- drawCardFromBottom: last card in array
- drawRandomCard: get a random index in the deck and show on DOM
- showDeck: displays the full deck in order on the screen
- shuffleDeck: randomizes the deck
- hideAll: clears the DOM
- click on a card and it will tell you on what card you clicked

We'll start with some basic HTML, CSS, and JS. I've included a starting framework including an array of cards, some basic styles, and some images to approximate cards.

We'll do a lecture, then you'll have time to recreate. Then we'll explore a bit more as a class.
